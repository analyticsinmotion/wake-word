## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- AGENTS.md with project conventions, commands, architecture, and boundaries for AI coding agents.
- ESLint configuration (.eslintrc.json) with TypeScript support.
- CHANGELOG now follows Keep a Changelog format with semantic versioning.

### Changed

- Updated extension display name to "Wake Word".
- Updated extension description to "Voice control for VS Code with customizable wake word. Fully local, zero config."
- Updated extension icon to fill the full 128x128 frame with dark background.
- Bumped `@typescript-eslint/parser` and `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` from ^6.18.0 to ^8.56.1.
- Activation event changed from `onStartup` to `onStartupFinished` for deferred loading.
- Auto-start now deferred by 1 second to allow VS Code to finish initialising.
- Consent dialog no longer disables `enableOnStartup` when dismissed.
- Configuration change listener now only restarts the engine when `wakeWord.routes` changes, not all settings.

### Fixed

- PowerShell injection vulnerability: switched from double-quoted to single-quoted strings for user-provided phrases in generated PowerShell script.
- `executeCommand` is now properly awaited with correct error handling for async failures.
- Removed premature `isActive = true` assignment in `resumeListening()` -- state is now set by the "started" event handler.
- Removed duplicate `setStatusBar("handed-off")` call on wake word detection.
- Added concurrency guard (`isStarting` flag) to prevent multiple consent dialogs.
- `stop()` no longer emits "stopped" when already stopped.
- `resume()` no longer clears paused state prematurely -- defers to "started" event.
- Added `dispose()` method to SpeechEngine for proper event listener cleanup on deactivation.
- Added route validation to filter out entries with empty phrase, label, or command.
- Fixed unnecessary escape character warnings in PowerShell split patterns.
- Fixed `catch (err: any)` to use `catch (err: unknown)` with proper type narrowing.
- Buffered stderr to handle PowerShell CLIXML chunked output, parsed on process exit.
- Added `_killedIntentionally` flag to suppress spurious error messages from intentional process kills.
- Removed dead `customText` parameter from `setStatusBar()`.
